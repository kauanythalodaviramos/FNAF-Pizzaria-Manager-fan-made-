Is basically an app made with delphi inspired by Five Nights at Freddy's pizzaria. 

"Michael Afton" ( fictional character of FNAF's franchise ) frequently used it while de FNAF2 events to organize the restaurant and employee stuff, just like the animatronics.

What can you do with it?
You can register new Items like **Pizza** and other **ingredients** or **drinks**; 
You can register new **Animatronics** in the system.
You can monitorate the quantity of a specific Item.
You can monitorate the **animatronic's state** ( if they are broken or bad-functioning ).
You can register new employees, such as enterteiners ( and relate them about what animatronic suit they will wear ), technicians ( to deal with animatronic fixing stuff ), general attendent ( people responsible for making pizza and stuff like that ) and the Guards ( responsible for protecting the enterprise and monitorating the pizzaria at night or day turn ).
